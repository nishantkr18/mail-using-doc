# Instructions to run:

Create a folder names "docs". Upload your txt files there.

Since the project works using OpenAI, you will have to create an API key here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Once you have your key, paste it in the ".env.example" file and rename this file to ".env".

Finally, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python run.py
```
